    /// Adds an entity or parameter this feature is dependent on. This is used by Fusion to know
    /// when to recompute this feature and to control the behavior of the feature's node in the timeline.
    /// id : An ID for this dependency. This is used to allow you to identify which dependency is which in the future.
    /// The ID must be unique with respect to the other dependencies of this custom feature.
    /// entity : The entity or parameter you want to add as a dependency. This can be a BRepBody, BRepFace, BrepEdge,
    /// BRepVertex, a sketch, any sketch entities, a profile, any construction geometry, or any parameter.
    /// Returns true if the dependency was successfully added.
    bool addDependency(const std::string& id, const core::Ptr<core::Base>& entity);

    /// Defines the information needed to create a new custom parameter that will be associated with
    /// this feature. A custom parameter appears as a model parameter and will be listed as a child of the
    /// custom feature in the parameter dialog. The custom feature will automatically have a dependency
    /// on this parameter.
    /// id : An id for this parameter. This is used to allow you to identify the parameter in the future. This
    /// must be unique with respect to all other parameters associated with this custom feature. It's needed
    /// because the label does not need to be unique and the Fusion auto-generated name can be edited by
    /// the user.
    /// label : The label for this parameter as seen in the parameters dialog. This identifies to the user the purpose
    /// of this parameter. For example, when you create an extrusion with a specific distance, there are two
    /// parameters displayed in the parameters dialog with the labels "AlongDistance" and "TaperAngle". This does
    /// not have to be unique because in the case of a fillet feature there can be multiple parameters all labeled "Radius".
    /// value : ValueInput object that specifies the value of the parameter. If the ValueInput was created using a real,
    /// the value will be interpreted using the internal unit for the unit type specified by the "units" argument.
    /// For example, if the ValueInput was created using the real value 5 and the input to the "units" argument is
    /// any valid length unit, the value will be interpreted as 5 centimeters since centimeters is the internal unit
    /// for lengths. If the "units" argument is a valid angle unit the value will be interpreted as 5 radians.
    /// 
    /// If the ValueInput was created using a string, the string is used as-is for the expression of the parameter.
    /// This means if there are units as part of the string it must evaluate to the same unit type as that specified
    /// by the "units" argument and if no units are specified it will use the current default units specified for
    /// the current document. For example, if the ValueInput was created with the string "5 in", then the "units"
    /// argument must define any valid length so it is compatible. If the ValueInput was created with the string "5",
    /// any unit type can be used and the result will be 5 of that unit.
    /// 
    /// When using a ValueInput created using a string, it's the same as creating a parameter in the user-interface.
    /// You can specify any valid expression, i.e. "5", "5 in", "5 in / 2", "5 + Length", etc. and you can choose
    /// from many different types of units. The only requirement is that the units must match in type. For example,
    /// they must both be lengths, or they must both be angles.
    /// units : The units to use for the value of the parameter. Units specified must match the units specified (if any)
    /// in the ValueInput object.
    /// 
    /// To create a parameter with no units (unitless) you can specify either an empty string.
    /// isVisible : Optional argument that specifies if the parameter will be visible in the parameters dialog or not. By
    /// default the parameter will be visible.
    /// 
    /// This can be useful in cases where the feature can be edited to be in different states where a parameter
    /// is only valid in a certain state. You can change the visibility based on the current state of the feature
    /// and if that parameter should be available for edit. This implies that you create all the parameters that
    /// might be needed and then change their visibility based on the current state of the feature. The parameters
    /// that are not visible will not be returned by the ModelParameters collection and are only available through
    /// the custom feature they're associated with.

    /// and all features between them in the timeline.

    /// the first and last features returned. If the custom feature contains a single feature,
